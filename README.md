Collection of „few” tasks, that I’ve done during my Postgraduate Studies (JavaScript Developer) at Politechnika Bialostocka in Bialystok. Each chapter (folder) includes individual ReadMe describing the tasks.

Please remember to install dependencies everytime:
`npm i`

In most cases, you need to run `node app` in your terminal. If it's different - it's in particular `README.md`. When it comes to work with API and databases, we need HTTP client (Postman for instance).

Unfortunately for now particular "readmies" are in Polish.
